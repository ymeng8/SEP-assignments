2. Differences between value type and reference type variables:
Value type variables directly hold the value, while reference type holds the memory address or reference for the value.
Value type variables are created by struct or enum, while reference type created by class, intereface, delegate, array.
Value type variables are stored in stack memory, while reference type stored in heap memory.
Only reference type variables are managed by garbage collector.
Only reference type variables accept null value.

Boxing converts a value type variable into a reference type variable.
Unboxing converts a reference type variable into a value type variable.
